## Introduction

Picture this: You’re chatting with a friend who’s excited because they just bought a bond from a promising company, and tucked alongside it was something called a “warrant.” They explain they’re allowed to buy shares of the company at a set price—sometimes over several years—and they’re dreaming of the day the stock soars above that price. Meanwhile, you recall another situation where an established firm announced a “rights issue,” offering existing shareholders a chance to buy additional shares at a discount. Both of these are ways companies raise capital, and both can be great opportunities—or potential pitfalls—for investors. In this segment, we’ll explore share warrants and rights issues in depth, focusing on how they’re structured, how they affect companies and investors, and what you should look out for when analyzing them.

Throughout this reading, we’ll draw from foundational concepts introduced in earlier sections—for instance, consider how Chapter 1’s discussion of equity as a source of capital offers a backdrop for why companies might bundle warrants with other securities. We’ll also build on the knowledge from Chapter 5’s broader review of equity security types. By the end, you’ll not only have a solid technical understanding of warrants and rights issues, but you’ll also (hopefully) feel confident in evaluating whether they make sense in an investment strategy.

## What Are Warrants?

A warrant is a lot like a long-dated option, but with an important twist: it’s issued by the company itself rather than traded purely on an exchange. The holder of a warrant has the right—but no obligation—to buy shares from the company at a certain “exercise” (or “strike”) price before the expiration date. 

• Longer expiration: Warrants often last years, unlike standard exchange-traded options that might only last a few months.  
• Issuer is the company: When the holder exercises the warrant, the company issues new shares, which can dilute existing shareholders.  
• Often attached to other securities: Companies commonly attach warrants to bonds or preferred shares to make these securities more appealing to investors.  

Imagine you buy a bond that yields a steady coupon. As a sweetener, the bond might come with a warrant allowing you to purchase the issuer’s shares at, say, $10 per share, good for the next five years. If the market price of the shares climbs above $10—let’s say it jumps to $15—and you still hold the warrant, you can exercise it, buy the stock at $10, and either keep it or sell it at $15, capturing a profit (minus any transaction costs).

In a sense, warrants can offer significant upside potential. But like any security, they have risk: If the share price never climbs above $10, your warrant will expire worthless. When that happens, you lose the money you may have paid for the warrant or the premium effectively baked into the bond’s price.

## What Are Rights Issues?

A rights issue is a different way for companies to raise new capital by issuing shares to existing shareholders—often at a discount—to encourage participation and preserve shareholder loyalty. Rights issues commonly happen when a company needs substantial funding for expansion, acquisitions, or paying down debt. Rather than letting outside investors swoop in first, the firm offers its current shareholders the “right” to buy additional shares in proportion to their existing holdings.

In many markets, you can even trade these rights on the exchange for a limited time if you don’t want to subscribe. This arrangement gives shareholders some flexibility:  
• They can subscribe to the rights, injecting fresh capital into the company.  
• They can sell the rights to other investors in the market.  
• They can simply let the rights lapse (although that typically isn’t the most beneficial route, financially speaking).  

Rights will usually have a “subscription period,” a set timeframe—often a few weeks—during which the shareholder has to decide. After that, if the shareholder doesn’t act, the rights expire. In most cases, the subscription price is below the share’s market price. That discount might seem like attracting “free money,” but there’s a catch: once new shares are issued, everyone’s ownership percentage shifts, and the share price might adjust to reflect the company’s bigger equity base.

Here’s a simplified formula for computing an approximate “ex-rights” share price after the rights issue:

{{< katex >}}
P_{\text{ex-rights}} = \frac{(n \times P_{\text{cum}}) + S}{n + 1}
{{< /katex >}}

where  
• \\(P_{\text{cum}}\\) is the share price before the rights issue (“cum rights”),  
• \\(S\\) is the subscription price for one new share,  
• \\(n\\) is the number of rights needed to buy one new share (the ratio of existing shares to new shares).  

The idea is that the total market value of the old shares plus the new shares at the subscription price is spread across a larger number of shares, hence the “ex-rights” price might be lower than the former price. (Yes, that can sound a bit perplexing at first, but that’s the result of new shares being introduced at a discount.)

## Key Differences Between Warrants and Rights

• Issuance and Purpose:  
  - Warrants: Often issued as “sweeteners” alongside bonds or preferred stocks to entice investors.  
  - Rights: Specifically designed to raise new equity capital by giving existing shareholders a chance to maintain their proportional ownership.  

• Time Horizon:  
  - Warrants: Typically longer-term—measured in years.  
  - Rights: Typically short-term, with a subscription period of a few weeks.  

• Origin of New Shares:  
  - Warrants: If exercised, the company issues entirely new shares.  
  - Rights: The company also issues new shares, but only after the rights period, in direct proportion to the number of rights redeemed.  

• Dilution:  
  - Warrants: Potential dilution can be significant if the exercise price is eventually surpassed by the market price.  
  - Rights: Dilution can happen if existing shareholders don’t participate or sell their rights, but the process is more immediate and straightforward.  

## Real-World Case Study: A Friend’s Warrant Windfall

Let me share a short anecdote from a few years ago: A friend of mine invested in the bonds of a mid-sized tech company that was struggling to attract investors. As part of the deal, the company threw in warrants to sweeten the pot. I remember my friend actually forgot about the warrants. Some time passed—and the tech industry took off. Suddenly, that little company’s share price more than doubled, well above the strike price. My friend was able to exercise the warrants, buy shares at the strike price, and then sell them for a tidy profit. Not every scenario ends in profit—after all, if the stock had gone nowhere, the warrants would have expired worthless. But that’s the real-life upside if you’re on the right side of market sentiment.

## Mechanics of Exercising Warrants

When companies attach warrants to securities, they specify the exercise price and expiration date. If you hold a warrant and wish to exercise, you typically notify the company (or your broker) and pay the strike price. The company issues fresh shares to you. One important nuance is that many modern warrants (and also certain employee stock options) allow for “net share settlement.” That means, instead of physically paying cash, you might net out the difference between the stock price and strike price in shares. However, the essential principle of exercise remains the same: new shares appear, diluting existing shareholders.

## Timeline for a Rights Issue

Below is a simplified depiction of how a rights issue typically unfolds:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Announcement <br/>Date"] --> B["Subscription <br/>Period Opens"]
    B --> C["Subscription <br/>Period Closes"]
    C --> D["Shares <br/>Allotted & Issued"]
```

• Announcement Date: The firm announces its intention to raise capital through a rights issue, details the discount, ratio, and subscription price.  
• Subscription Period Opens: Existing shareholders can exercise (buy more shares at the discount) or sell the rights on the market if the rights are transferable.  
• Subscription Period Closes: After this date, any unexercised rights typically become worthless.  
• Shares Allotted & Issued: The company finalizes the process, distributing new shares to those who exercised their rights.

## Practical Financial Example: Rights Issue

Let’s do a simple numeric example. Suppose:

• Current share price (cum rights) = $20  
• Subscription price = $15  
• Every 4 existing shares allow you to buy 1 new share.  

So, \\( n = 4 \\). Using our ex-rights price formula:

{{< katex >}}
P_{\text{ex-rights}} = \frac{(4 \times 20) + 15}{4 + 1} = \frac{80 + 15}{5} = \frac{95}{5} = 19
{{< /katex >}}

In principle, once you subscribe and pay $15 per new share, the theoretical new share price might settle around $19. The exact actual trading price can differ, but the formula helps you estimate where the stock might open post-rights.  

Shareholders who subscribe keep their overall proportion of ownership roughly the same; those who don’t subscribe or sell their rights face ownership dilution.

## Modeling Scenarios for Rights Issues in Python (Optional Snippet)

Sometimes, you want a quick scenario analysis. Let’s do a tiny Python snippet to show how you might simulate different market conditions for ex-rights pricing:

```python
import numpy as np

def ex_rights_price(p_cum, sub_price, ratio):
    # ratio = n (number of old shares entitling 1 new share)
    return ((ratio * p_cum) + sub_price) / (ratio + 1)

current_price = 20
sub_price = [10, 15, 18]  # Different possible subscription prices
ratio = 4

for s in sub_price:
    ex_price = ex_rights_price(current_price, s, ratio)
    print(f"Subscription Price: {s}, Estimated Ex-Rights Price: {ex_price:.2f}")
```

While exam questions won’t always require you to code, being able to systematically compare changes in subscription price or ratio can sharpen your intuition about how rights issues impact share valuation.

## Analyzing Warrants: Key Considerations

• Exercise Price vs. Market Price: The intrinsic value of a warrant at any point is max(0, market price of the underlying – exercise price). If your warrant’s strike is $10 but the stock is trading at $8, that warrant is out of the money.  

• Time Value: Warrants can maintain value even when they’re out of the money due to the possibility the stock could rise in future. This is similar to how options trade.  

• Dilution Impact: Each time warrants get exercised, new shares are created. This extra supply can pressure the share price downward, depending on how efficiently the market anticipates the dilution and divides the company’s earnings among more shares.  

• Company Fundamentals: Warrants can look technically enticing, but if the company’s underlying business model is shaky, the stock might not surpass the warrant’s exercise price.  

## Analyzing Rights Issues: Key Considerations

• Rationale for Raising Capital: Is the company using the newfound capital for a strategic acquisition? To pay down expensive debt? Or for bridging liquidity shortfalls? The reason behind the capital raise matters to your long-term outlook on share value.  

• Discount Magnitude: A hefty discount to market price can signal the company is very eager to get funds fast. It might also reflect market skepticism about the firm’s financial well-being.  

• Opportunity Cost: Even though the rights come at a discount, investing more money in the same stock might double down on the same risk. Existing shareholders must gauge diversification concerns.  

• Trading the Rights: If the rights are transferable, an investor who doesn’t want to participate can sell the rights in the open market. That’s typically better than letting them expire worthless.  

• Dilution for Non-Participants: If you do nothing, your percentage ownership likely shrinks. Some long-term investors prefer to maintain their stake, while others might be comfortable reducing their exposure.

## Potential Risks and Common Pitfalls

• Overconfidence: Investors may assume they’ll definitely profit from warrants if the share price is “bound to rise.” There’s no guarantee.  

• Ignoring the Expiration: A surprisingly large cohort forgets or neglects looming deadlines for warrants or rights, missing their opportunity to capitalize or salvage value.  

• Mis-Valuing Dilution: Buying stock in a rights issue at a discount can feel like a bargain, but failing to incorporate the post-issue share count can be disastrous for your analysis.  

• Focusing Only on the Discount: A discount in a rights issue does not automatically mean free money; the ex-rights price adjusts. Similarly, the value of a warrant is strongly tied to the underlying stock’s trajectory.  

• Liquidity Challenges: Not all warrants or rights trade on deep secondary markets. Low liquidity can lead to large bid-ask spreads, complicating buy or sell decisions.

## Integration with Equity Valuation

From the perspective of the broader equity valuation models discussed in Chapter 9 (Dividend Discount Models, FCFE Models, and so on), the new capital obtained via warrants or rights can alter the company’s free cash flows and growth rates. For instance, a successful rights issue might reduce leverage, leading to lower interest expenses, which can spur higher net income in future. Or, if the capital raise finances expansion, the company’s revenues might get a boost. 

It’s important to incorporate these shifts into your valuation assumptions—both in forecasting the potential upside of the business and in the share count used to compute the per-share metrics.

## Ethical and Governance Considerations

In line with the themes we discussed in Chapter 10 (ESG Considerations in Equity Investments), it’s worth asking: How transparent is the company about its capital-raising activities? Are they issuing warrants or conducting repeated rights issues in a way that unfairly dilutes minority shareholders or transfers wealth to insiders? Investors should monitor the fair treatment of all shareholder classes and check if controlling shareholders are also subscribing in the rights issue. Questions around corporate governance become even more relevant for private placements of warrants.

## Best Practices and Strategies

• Stay Ahead of Deadlines: Put reminders in your calendar for subscription and expiration dates.  
• Do the Math: Always calculate a rough ex-rights price or intrinsic value. Don’t rely solely on “gut feelings.”  
• Evaluate the Company’s Fundamentals: Both warrants and rights issues revolve around the notion that the company’s stock won’t stagnate. So it’s crucial to determine if the firm’s fundamentals support future growth.  
• Plan for Dilution: If you’re using valuation metrics like EPS (Earnings Per Share), factor in potential increases in share count.  
• Decide if You Want to Participate: For rights issues, you can subscribe to maintain (or even increase) your share in the company—or you can sell your rights if you want to reduce exposure.

## Final Thoughts for Exam Preparation

In an exam setting—particularly in scenario-based questions—you might be asked to:

• Calculate the ex-rights share price and comment on the effect on the company’s share structure.  
• Evaluate whether an investor should exercise warrants or buy them on the open market.  
• Discuss how new equity capital from rights or warrant exercises might affect the company’s growth and profitability.  
• Recognize potential pitfalls—like ignoring the time limits or mispricing the warrant’s time value—that can affect portfolio outcomes.

When constructing your responses to essay or item set questions, methodically walk through the rationale for the capital raise, recognize the implications for ownership dilution, do some simple math for ex-rights or warrant valuation, and conclude with an analysis of how these moves improve (or undermine) the firm’s capital structure. And hey, always keep a calm mind about the fact that rights and warrants can expire worthless if not in-the-money or properly exercised. The CFA® Program loves exploring those “What if?” corners—so be ready to discuss the consequences of letting them lapse.

## Test Your Knowledge on Share Warrants and Rights Issues

{{< quizdown >}}

### Which of the following statements best describes a share warrant?

- [ ] A short-term offer allowing shareholders to buy new shares at a discount.
- [x] A security issued by a company giving its holder the right to purchase shares at a specified price.
- [ ] A contract traded on an exchange specifying a future purchase of shares at the current price.
- [ ] A bond-like instrument that converts automatically into equity at maturity.

> **Explanation:** Warrants are long-term instruments issued by the company itself, granting holders the right (but not the obligation) to purchase shares at a specified exercise price before the warrant expires.

### In a rights issue, the subscription price is typically:

- [ ] Higher than the prevailing market price to boost company capital.
- [ ] Equal to the market price of the stock on the offer date.
- [x] Below the prevailing market price to encourage participation.
- [ ] Determined solely by the underwriters’ internal valuation model.

> **Explanation:** Rights issues usually feature a subscription price below the market price to incentivize shareholders to buy more shares, ensuring the success of the capital raise.

### If the current stock price is $25, and the exercise price of the warrant is $20, the intrinsic value of the warrant is:

- [x] $5
- [ ] $45
- [ ] $20
- [ ] $25

> **Explanation:** Intrinsic value for any option-like security is the excess of the current market price over the strike (exercise) price if that difference is positive. Here, $25 – $20 = $5.

### A key difference between a warrant and a rights issue is:

- [ ] Rights provide a longer time horizon than warrants.
- [x] Warrants are often attached to other securities, whereas rights are targeted to existing shareholders.
- [ ] Rights are frequently out-of-the-money, while warrants are always at par.
- [ ] Warrants are short-term, while rights are long-term.

> **Explanation:** Warrants commonly come attached to bonds or preferred stock as a sweetener. Rights, on the other hand, are specifically allocated to existing shareholders to purchase additional stock.

### Which of the following best explains a possible outcome for an investor who does not participate in a rights issue and does not sell their rights?

- [ ] The investor retains exactly the same ownership stake in the firm.
- [ ] The investor automatically receives newly issued shares.
- [x] The investor’s percentage ownership in the firm is diluted.
- [ ] The investor is given an equivalent number of warrants instead.

> **Explanation:** When an investor no longer exercises or sells their rights, their ownership percentage shrinks because new shares are issued to other participants.

### What is the primary benefit of attaching warrants to other securities like bonds?

- [ ] Warrants primarily reduce the issuer’s credit risk.
- [ ] Warrants force shareholders to exercise and buy shares.
- [ ] Warrants guarantee a fixed dividend payment.
- [x] Warrants make the overall offering more attractive to potential investors.

> **Explanation:** Attaching warrants is a strategic move to sweeten the deal for investors—if the stock price appreciates, the warrants potentially become very valuable.

### From an investor’s standpoint, a significant risk of owning warrants is:

- [ ] Having to repay the principal at maturity.
- [x] Risk of expiration if the market price remains below the exercise price.
- [ ] Immediate dilution of the company’s capital base.
- [ ] Mandatory conversion into preferred stock.

> **Explanation:** If the underlying share price never rises above the warrant’s exercise price, the warrant can expire worthless, posing a risk for the investor.

### When assessing a rights issue, which factor is typically least relevant?

- [ ] The company’s rationale for raising capital.
- [x] Management’s personal credit score.
- [ ] The time window (subscription period).
- [ ] The discount in the subscription price.

> **Explanation:** While financial health, rationale, discount, and subscription period are crucial elements to evaluate a rights offering, an executive’s personal credit score is generally not a standard factor in analyzing its investment potential.

### After a rights issue is completed, the share price may decline because:

- [ ] The firm’s fundamentals improved materially.
- [ ] No new shares were issued to the public.
- [x] Greater number of shares are outstanding, diluting the share price.
- [ ] The subscription price was much higher than the market price.

> **Explanation:** Issuing new shares at a discount increases the total share count, which often causes a downward adjustment in the share price on an ex-rights basis.

### A “net share settlement” feature for a warrant means:

- [x] The holder can receive the difference between the market price and the exercise price in shares instead of paying cash.
- [ ] The company will issue debt securities instead of shares upon exercise.
- [ ] The warrant holder must pay the entire strike price in cash.
- [ ] The exercise price automatically adjusts to the market price on the exercise date.

> **Explanation:** Net share settlement allows the warrant holder to forego a cash payment and instead convert the “in-the-money” portion of the warrant into additional shares from the company.
